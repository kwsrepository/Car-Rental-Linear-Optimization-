# Car Rental Problem - Linear Optimization
This project was completed for my Linear and Discrete Optimization module, where I received a Distinction. It addresses the optimization problems outlined in sections 12.25 "Car Rental 1" and 12.26 "Car Rental 2" of the Problem Description document. For each problem, I provide solutions using both Excel spreadsheets and LP Solve. 

You can find a video on my YouTube channel where I briefly explain and demonstrate the design and effectiveness of these solutions.
